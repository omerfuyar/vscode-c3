# vscode-c3

This fork of the [original repo](https://github.com/c3lang/vscode-c3.git) is not something serious but somewhere that I can try and test VS Code extensions. I am just trying to add new features and refactor the codebase to do something better.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omerfuyar/vscode-c3.git
cd vscode-c3

npm install
npm run build
```

In vscode head over to the extensions section and click on the 3 dots. From there select "Install from VSIX ..." and select the newly created file
